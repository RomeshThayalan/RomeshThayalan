- 👋 Hi, I’m @RomeshThayalan
- 👀 I’m interested in simulation engineering - particularly CFD - and its uses for a wide variety of applications. I have previously worked as an aerodynamicist at Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team during my industrial placement year using and analysing CFD extensively as well as validating these results in wind tunnel tests.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the application of non-Newtonian viscosity models of blood in CFD and their effect on thrombosis in blood pumps, and the flow instabilities in intracranial aneurysms derived from Magnetic Resonance data. I am soon to be learning about using HPC and cloud computing for my research endeavours
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CFD and simulation projects to have a positive impact on the world - be that in healthcare, assisting in the energy transition, improving aerospace and road vehicle efficiency, and any other ways possible! I am always hungry to learn and want to understand how machine learning and aritificial intelligence can be applied to this field.
